# Catacomb
A bare bones database.

I built Catacomb for my _Nugget_ app. I wanted a simple way to store my app's data. The obvious solution was just to use the FS module to write JSON to disk. LokiJS did this, but it felt more complicated than just doing it "by hand". Catacomb is an attempt to make it even easier.

If you find yourself asking, "Why does this even exist? It's barely worth a module!", well I _did_ say it was "bare bones."
